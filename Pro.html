						<p class="lead">President Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton made waves this week when he said he'd testify at Trump's impeachment trial if subpoenaed.
                        For 17 months, Bolton was Trump's top adviser on national security. He was fired in September, one day before Trump lifted the freeze on US military assistance for Ukraine. Bolton's role in Trump's orbit put him at the center of several important moments throughout the Ukraine affair.Here's a chronological breakdown of what Bolton could testify about. Most of these details come from other witnesses who testified in the House impeachment inquiry. It's likely there is even more for Bolton to share, including things that aren't yet public, but it's hard to know for sure
